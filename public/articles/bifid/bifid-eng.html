<h1>Bifid Cipher</h1>

<p>
  The Bifid cipher is an encryption system that uses the Polybius square (or
  table), similar to the one used in the Playfair cipher, but with different row
  and column operations. However, an important distinction must be made here:
  referring to this table simply as a "Polybius square" isn't entirely accurate.
  Typically, more advanced, scrambled versions or those with different character
  combinations are used.
</p>

<h2>Classic Polybius Table and Its Limitations</h2>
<p>
  The classic Polybius square contains only letters. This means numbers and
  punctuation marks remain unencrypted. However, when the plaintext contains
  numbers and punctuation marks, leaving them exposed can make the cipher easier
  to break. Therefore, in modern applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including numbers in the table,</li>
  <li>Accounting for punctuation marks,</li>
  <li>Using a randomized table</li>
</ul>
<p>
  is recommended. This makes the encryption stronger and more difficult to
  crack.
</p>

<h2>Impact of Table Variations</h2>

<p>
  To understand how different table sizes affect security, let's consider a
  simple example. Imagine the same plaintext encrypted using both small and
  large tables.
</p>

  />

    alt="Small Polybius Table"
  />
  <p>
    Tables with varying coverage (the last one being the Polybius checkerboard)
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Using a table with limited coverage has several disadvantages. First, since
  numbers remain unencrypted (which are crucial in most encrypted
  communications), someone familiar with the subject could understand the
  content without needing to decrypt it. Additionally, incorporating punctuation
  marks into the encryption leaves no clues about the text, resulting in more
  secure encryption. Furthermore, a codebreaker familiar with the language
  structure could make inferences from such unencrypted elements and make
  significant progress in breaking the cipher.
</p>

<p>Let's examine these two examples.</p>
<p>
  For plaintext, let's use "Shall we meet at 17:00?". If we encrypt this using
  the classic Polybius table, we get the following result.
</p>
<b>RCOCA PS OGJO YD 17:00? </b>
<p>
  If someone intercepting the encrypted message realizes it's about a meeting,
  they could easily determine the time without decrypting it. Or they might
  deduce that "YD" corresponds to "at". Now let's look at the version encrypted
  with a more comprehensive table.
</p>
<b>Wfpwxeygv8U.?U{i56Rg9{</b>
<p>
  Most likely, the person who intercepts this encrypted message would simply put
  it back where they found it.
</p>

<p>
  In this article, I'll use examples based on a medium-sized table - one that's
  neither too complex nor too simple.
</p>

<h2>History and Etymology</h2>
<p>
  The Bifid cipher was developed in 1895 by French cryptographer Félix Marie
  Delastelle. He could even be considered an amateur cryptographer, having spent
  most of his life working in a harbor. Before his death in 1902, he wrote a
  book titled <em>Traité Élémentaire de Cryptographie</em> but couldn't publish
  it. However, he did present the Bifid cipher in a journal in 1895. He's also
  known for the Trifid cipher.
</p>

<p>
  The word "Bifid" comes from Latin, originating from "bifidus," meaning "split
  in two."
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Bi" = two</li>
  <li>"Fid" = to split, to divide</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This naming isn't coincidental, as the encryption process involves exactly two
  stages and a division method.
</p>

<h2>Encryption Steps</h2>

<p>An example will make the encryption steps easier to understand.</p>

<p>Let's use "CRYPTOGRAPHY" as our plaintext.</p>

<b>Finding Corresponding Values in the Table</b>
<br />
<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img
    src="/articles/bifid/polybius_medium_table.png"
    alt="Medium Polybius Table Example"
  />
</div>

<p>
  The table we'll use is shown above. We find the coordinates for each letter,
  with rows as i and columns as j indices.
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc1.png" alt="Coordinate Finding Example" />
</div>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc4.png" alt="Coordinate Representation" />
</div>

<b>Splitting the Coordinates</b>
<p>After obtaining all coordinates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, all row (i) values are written,</li>
  <li>Then all column (j) values are written.</li>
</ul>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc2.png" alt="Coordinate Separation" />
</div>

<p>We can represent this generalized structure as follows.</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img
    src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc3.png"
    alt="General Coordinate Structure"
  />
</div>

<b>Dividing Numbers into Digraphs</b>

<p>
  The resulting number sequence is divided into digraphs (pairs of numbers):
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc6.png" alt="Digraph Creation" />
</div>
<p>
  We can represent this generalized structure as follows. The process may vary
  depending on whether the plaintext has an even or odd number of characters.
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc5.png" alt="General Digraph Structure" />
</div>

<b>Finding Letter Equivalents for the Encrypted Message</b>
<p>
  The digraphs give us the coordinates of the encrypted message. All that
  remains is to find the corresponding letters using the table.
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc7.png" alt="Encrypted Message Creation" />
</div>

<p>
  Thus, the encrypted version of <b>"CRYPTOGRAPHY"</b> becomes
  <b>"C0UICKRDIFDG"</b>.
</p>

<h2>Decryption Steps</h2>

<p>Decryption essentially reverses the encryption steps.</p>

<b>Finding Coordinates from the Encrypted Message</b>
<p>We start by recreating the table used in the final encryption step.</p>
<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc7.png" alt="Decryption Table" />
</div>
<b>Splitting the Coordinates</b>
<p>
  This time, instead of writing all i coordinates first followed by j
  coordinates, we take the (i,j) pairs in order, then remove the digraph
  separation to create a single sequence.
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-long">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc6.png" alt="Coordinate Separation" />
</div>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc2.png" alt="Number Sequence" />
</div>

<b>Splitting in Half</b>
<p>The number sequence is divided exactly in half.</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-dec1.png" alt="Splitting the Sequence" />
</div>

<b>Combining the Parts</b>
<p>
  You may notice something interesting about the two resulting parts. The first
  part contains the i coordinates we wrote during encryption, while the second
  contains the j coordinates. By placing the second part beneath the first, we
  recreate the original coordinates we had during encryption.
</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-dec2.png" alt="Combining Coordinates" />
</div>

<p>Which means we've essentially reconstructed:</p>

<div class="article-image article-image-small">
  <img src="/articles/bifid/crypto-enc1.png" alt="Original Coordinates" />
</div>

<b>Finding Letter Equivalents for the Decrypted Message</b>

<p>The image above shows we've successfully achieved our desired result.</p>
